On the BACK TO BACK MIRROR TANDEM BIKE the person riding reversed has an exquisite feeling during the ride.

<p>
The special chain gear makes possible a normal pedalling.

<p>
The person in the back has no obstacle in observing the view, as on an average tandem bike.

The BACK TO BACK MIRROR TANDEM BIKE has a specific, unique feature, compared to other tandem bikes known as BACK TO BACK.

The person sitting in the back seat has the possibility to steer the bike from the back with the help of a bowden wire steering mechanism while going backwards.
