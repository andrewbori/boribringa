Riding the RODEO BIKE our feeling is like riding a wild horse, obviously this bike isn't so dangerous.
The rear part moves up-down and the first one left-right. </br>
</p>

<p>
The bike has a special, modified gear::

<p>
The axle of the rear wheel is not placed in the centre, but shifted any centimeters.
</p>

<p>
The axle is not abeam with the plain geometry of the first wheel.

Riding the "rodeobicikli" in a flat way we have the feeling like riding in a very undulating road.
By a higher velocity the bike will shake off the rider.
