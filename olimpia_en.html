<h2>Why was it made?</h2>
<p>
Firstly for my pleasure, on the other hand on the occassion of the Olympic Games of 2004.
</p>
<p>
The OLYMPIC BIKE is a vehicle, but it can be declared as a kinetic sculpture,
because the placing and colour of the 5 wheels suggests the five rings of the Olimpic simbols.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
Every wheel is rotating when we are riding the bike.

<h2>How was it made?</h2>
<p>
The base of the OLYMPIC BIKE is a Camping bike, with wheels of 20 inches. <br/>
I rebuilt the fork into a double fork constructed on above the other.
The wheel mounted on the upper fork is moved by friction with the wheel in the lower one.
</p>
<p>
In the rear i mounted a fork from a 28 inch bike so the upper wheel in the back is also moved by friction.
</p>
<p>
The middle part of the framework was completely rebuilt.
The chainwheel of the middle wheel is connected by a chain to the chainwheel which receives drive from the pedals.

<h2>How can I brake with this vehicle?</h2>

<p>
The OLYMPIC BIKE has three independently working brakes:
<ol>
<li>a coaster brake, controlling the back wheel by foot.</li>
<li>the driving brake controlling by right hand braking the lower back wheel.</li>
<li>the driving brake controlled by the left hand which stops the middle wheel.</li>
</ol>
